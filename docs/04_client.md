### Client

The client can be anything that can send a request to the server. It can be a CLI or a GUI or even a web app. You can check the [QuVery-CLI](https://github.com/QuVery/quvery-cli) and a GUI version will be available soon.
You also can use the API Doc directly by sending requests to the server from [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) after running the core executable.
