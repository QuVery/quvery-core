# QuVery Core

QuVery Core is the core library of QuVery. It provides the basic functions of QuVery to be used in other projects like QuVery-CLI or QuVery-GUI.

## Introduction

### For Artists

If you are an artist, you know that how hard and time consuming it is to get a message from the client that your file has some technical issues. QuVery is here to help you with that. It will check your file for any technical issues and will let you know if there is any. It will also provide you with a list of the issues and how to fix them. Of course it will not check everything but it will check the most common issues that can be found in a file.

### For Teams

If you are part of a team, QuVery can help streamline your workflow. By automating the process of checking files for technical issues, it can save your team valuable time and effort. It can also help ensure consistency across different team members' work, as it applies the same set of rules to every file it checks. This can be particularly useful for large teams or for teams working remotely, where it can be harder to maintain consistency.

### For Companies

QuVery can be a valuable addition to your company's CI/CD pipeline. By integrating QuVery into your CI/CD tool, you can automate the process of checking files for technical issues. This can help you catch and fix issues early in the development process, before they become more costly and time-consuming to resolve. It can also help ensure that all files meet your company's technical standards before they are deployed, which can improve the quality of your products and services.

Some of the advantages of integrating QuVery into your CI/CD pipeline include:

- **Early detection of issues:** QuVery can help you catch technical issues early in the development process, when they are typically easier and less costly to fix.

- **Improved quality control:** By automatically checking all files for technical issues, QuVery can help ensure that all files meet your company's technical standards before they are deployed.

- **Increased efficiency:** Automating the process of checking files for technical issues can save your team valuable time and effort, allowing them to focus on other important tasks.

- **Consistency:** QuVery applies the same set of rules to every file it checks, helping to ensure consistency across different team members' work.

Remember, QuVery is not just a tool, it's a solution to streamline your workflow and maintain the quality of your projects.
